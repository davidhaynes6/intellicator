 Monte Carlo simulations are a powerful mathematical and computational technique to model and analyze complex systems, including stock prices and financial markets. 
 Here's an explanation of how the application uses the Monte Carlo simulations for modeling stock prices: 
 
 Objective: 
 The objective of Monte Carlo simulations for stock prices is to estimate the range of possible future stock price scenarios based on certain assumptions 
 about the stock's behavior. 
 
 Stock Prices: 
 Initial Parameters:  Start with the current stock price (S0). Define the expected return (mu), which represents the average rate of return for the stock. Specify the volatility (sigma), 
 which measures the standard deviation of the stock's returns. Higher volatility indicates more significant price fluctuations. Determine the time horizon (T), which is the period over 
 which you want to simulate future prices. Set the number of simulations (N), representing the number of paths you want to simulate. Random Price Movements: 
 
 In each simulation, the model is the stock price movement over time. This is done by simulating random price changes or returns. This application uses a stochastic Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) model. 
 GBM assumes that stock returns are normally distributed and that future prices are influenced by drift (mu) and randomness (sigma). 
 For each simulation, the application generates random numbers (usually following a normal distribution) to represent price changes. 
 
 This application updates the stock price at each time step using the formula: S(t+1) = S(t) * exp((mu - (sigma^2) / 2) * delta_t + sigma * sqrt(delta_t) * Z), where delta_t is the time step and Z is a random number. 
 
 Repeat Simulations: 
 The application repeats the above process for many simulations (N times). Each simulation represents a possible path of stock price movements. 
 
 Collect Results: 
 As you complete the simulations,  you collect the final stock prices for each path. This collection of final prices represents a distribution of possible outcomes. 
 Analyze Results: You can analyze the distribution of final prices to understand the potential future scenarios. 
 
 Key statistics, such as the mean (average) final price and standard deviation, provide insights into the central tendency and variability of the simulated outcomes. 
 You can calculate probabilities associated with different price levels or returns.
